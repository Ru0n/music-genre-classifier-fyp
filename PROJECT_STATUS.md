# Music Genre Classifier - Project Status

## Overview
This project implements an interactive music genre classifier that allows users to upload audio files and receive predictions about the music genre. The system uses deep learning techniques to analyze audio spectrograms and classify them into different music genres.

## Current Status

### Completed Components

#### Backend
- Flask API setup with endpoints for:
  - Audio file upload
  - Genre prediction
  - Audio playback
- Audio processing pipeline for spectrogram generation
- Model loading and inference integration

#### Frontend
- React application with:
  - File upload component
  - Results display (genre, confidence, spectrogram visualization)
  - Audio playback functionality
  - Genre-based playlist organization

#### Machine Learning
- CNN model architecture design and implementation
- Training pipeline setup
- Initial model training completed
- Model weights saved and integrated with backend

#### Data Processing
- GTZAN dataset acquisition
- Spectrogram generation from audio files
- Audio loading functionality

### In Progress
- Documentation and reporting
  - Final project report
  - Project presentation/demo preparation
  - Code cleanup and commenting

### To Do
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Model architecture/hyperparameter optimization (if needed)
- Save processed spectrograms and labels for training

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
